List of the **resources and tools**needed  for the **CrewAI** x **Future AGI** asisgnment

### 1\. **APIs / SDKs / Libraries**

You will need to interact with the APIs and SDKs of **CrewAI** and **Future AGI** in order to build the integration:

#### a. **CrewAI SDK/API**

*   **CrewAI Account**: You’ll need a valid account with CrewAI to create and manage your agents.
    
*   Example:pip install crewai
    
    *   crewai-py or similar (you might need to install it via pip).
        
    *   **API Key/Secret Key**: You will need an API key from CrewAI for authentication and interaction with the API.
        

#### b. **Future AGI SDK/API**

*   **Future AGI Account**: You’ll need an account to access the platform and obtain an API key for making requests to their services.
    
*   Example:pip install future-agi
    
    *   The official SDK/API documentation will provide installation details and code examples.
        
    *   **API Key/Secret Key**: You will also need an API key from Future AGI for this.
        

#### c. **Other Libraries**:

*   **Python >= 3.10**: Make sure you’re working with the correct version of Python as per the assignment requirements.
    
*   **Flask/Django (Optional)**: If you want to deploy the solution as a web service, you may need a web framework.
    
*   **Requests**: To handle HTTP requests to the Future AGI API if it's a RESTful service.
    

### 2\. **Environment Configuration**

*   **API Keys and Secrets**: Both CrewAI and Future AGI will provide API keys and secrets for authentication.
    
    *   Store these keys in .env files or environment variables for security.
        
    *   CREWAI\_API\_KEY=your\_crewai\_api\_key\_hereFUTURE\_AGI\_API\_KEY=your\_future\_agi\_api\_key\_here
        
*   **Webhook URLs (Optional)**: If either CrewAI or Future AGI supports webhooks to get real-time updates or logs, you may need to configure a webhook URL in your app or cloud environment.
    

### 3\. **Agent Setup in CrewAI**

*   from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, Process# Example agent definitionagent = Agent(role='Customer Support', goal='Resolve customer queries')
    
    *   Example:
        

### 4\. **Future AGI Integration**

*   Example:from future\_agi import FutureAGIagi = FutureAGI(api\_key="your\_agi\_api\_key")agi.evaluate(agent\_output)
    
    *   The code snippet in the reference cookbook shows a simple way to integrate Future AGI by calling instrument\_crewai() or a similar method.
        
    *   Ensure you know how to configure the Future AGI integration to trace agent tasks, logs, and metrics.
        

### 5\. **Hosting/Run-time Environment**

*   **Cloud Platform or Local Setup**: You need a working environment where you can deploy and test your solution. This could be:
    
    *   **Local**: Running on your local machine, ensuring you have the appropriate Python environment set up.
        
    *   **Cloud Platforms** (optional): If your solution requires more scalability or deployment, use cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure.
        

### 6\. **Dashboard & Metrics Visualization (Optional)**

*   **Visualization of Data**: Some platforms provide dashboards for real-time observability of agent performance. If available, make sure you have access to these dashboards (for example, Future AGI may offer this).
    
    *   **Screenshots/Logs**: Use the dashboard to take screenshots or export logs that you can include in your cookbook, showing agent evaluation results, accuracy scores, and more.
        

### 7\. **Code Example Output / Logs**

*   **Example Workflow Output**: Create a sample agent workflow (e.g., customer query handling) and show the evaluation results in a format that demonstrates how Future AGI analyzes the agent's output (e.g., tone, accuracy, and helpfulness).
    

Example output:

### 8\. **Media Resources**

*   **Diagrams / Flowcharts**: A simple architecture diagram to illustrate the flow between CrewAI agents and Future AGI.
    
    *   Tools like **Lucidchart**, **Draw.io**, or **Microsoft Visio** can help you create these diagrams.
        
*   **Social Media Draft**: A short draft (200-250 words) for Twitter or LinkedIn summarizing the integration you built. This could be shared as part of the deliverables.
    

### 9\. **Documentation**

*   **Markdown File**: As per the assignment, the cookbook must be in **Markdown** format. This will include:
    
    *   **Code snippets** (with clear explanations).
        
    *   **Prerequisites** (tools, libraries, and APIs).
        
    *   **Steps** for setup, integration, and testing.
        
    *   **Output/Logs** from the integration.
        
    *   **Key takeaways** (what developers gain from using both CrewAI and Future AGI).
        

### 10\. **Additional Considerations**

*   **Error Handling & Debugging**: Make sure you include error-handling mechanisms to handle any integration failures or misconfigurations.
    
*   **Test Cases**: If relevant, include tests to verify that the integration works as expected.
